# IA-8(2) / Identification and Authentication (Non-organizational Users) | Acceptance of External Authenticators

_(IDENTIFICATIONS AND AUTHENTICATION)_

## Control Text


(a) Accept only external authenticators that are NIST-compliant; and
(b) Document and maintain a list of accepted external authenticators.

## Discussion

Acceptance of only NIST-compliant external authenticators applies to organizational systems that are accessible to the public (e.g., public-facing websites). External authenticators are issued by nonfederal government entities and are compliant with SP 800-63B. Approved external authenticators meet or exceed the minimum Federal Government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. Meeting or exceeding Federal requirements allows Federal Government relying parties to trust external authenticators in connection with an authentication transaction at a specified authenticator assurance level.
