# AC-2(3) / Account Management | Disable Accounts

_(ACCESS CONTROL)_

## Control Text

Disable accounts within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when the accounts:

(a) Have expired;
(b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual;
(c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or
(d) Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].

## Discussion

Disabling expired, inactive, or otherwise anomalous accounts supports the concepts of least privilege and least functionality which reduce the attack surface of the system.

## Implementation
