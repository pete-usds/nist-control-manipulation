# Identity Proofing | Address Confirmation

## Control Text

Require that a [Selection: registration code; notice of proofing] be delivered through an out-of-band channel to verify the users address (physical or digital) of record.

## Discussion

To make it more difficult for adversaries to pose as legitimate users during the identity proofing process, organizations can use out-of-band methods to ensure that the individual associated with an address of record is the same individual that participated in the registration. Confirmation can take the form of a temporary enrollment code or a notice of proofing. The delivery address for these artifacts is obtained from records and not self-asserted by the user. The address can include a physical or digital address. A home address is an example of a physical address. Email addresses and telephone numbers are examples of digital addresses.
