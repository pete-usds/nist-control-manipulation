# SC-10 / Network Disconnect

_(SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION)_

## Control Text

Terminate the network connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity.

## Discussion

Network disconnect applies to internal and external networks. Terminating network connections associated with specific communications sessions includes de-allocating TCP/IP address or port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating the networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. Periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.
