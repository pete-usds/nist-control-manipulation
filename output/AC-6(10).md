# ACCESS CONTROL: AC-6(10)
# Least Privilege | Prohibit Non-privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions

## Control Text

Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.

## Discussion

Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security or privacy controls, establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks, and administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users include circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms. Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions is enforced by AC-3.
