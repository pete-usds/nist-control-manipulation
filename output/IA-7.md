# IA-7 / Cryptographic Module Authentication

_(IDENTIFICATIONS AND AUTHENTICATION)_

## Control Text

Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.

## Discussion

Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator is authorized to assume the requested role and perform services within that role.
