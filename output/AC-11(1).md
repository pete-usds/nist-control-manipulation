# ACCESS CONTROL: AC-11(1)
# Device Lock | Pattern-hiding Displays

## Control Text

Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.

## Discussion

The pattern-hiding display can include static or dynamic images, such as patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank screen with the caveat that controlled unclassified information is not displayed.

## Implementation
