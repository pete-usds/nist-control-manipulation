# SC-7(5) / Boundary Protection | Deny by Default â€” Allow by Exception

_(SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION)_

## Control Text

Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception [Selection (one or more): at managed interfaces; for [Assignment: organization-defined systems]].

## Discussion

Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception also applies to a system that is connected to an external system.
