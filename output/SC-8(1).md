# SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION: SC-8(1)
# Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity | Cryptographic Protection

## Control Text

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one or more): prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to information] during transmission.

## Discussion

Encryption protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification during transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality and integrity of information during transmission include TLS and IPSec. Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect information integrity include cryptographic hash functions that have applications in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes.
