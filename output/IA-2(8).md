# IA-2(8) / Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) | Access to Accounts â€” Replay Resistant

_(IDENTIFICATIONS AND AUTHENTICATION)_

## Control Text

Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to [Selection (one or more): privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts].

## Discussion

Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or cryptographic authenticators.

## Implementation
